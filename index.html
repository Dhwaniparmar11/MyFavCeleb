                <h2><u>About :</u> </h2>
                            The actor is best known for essaying villainous roles in Indian cinema , is being hailed for 
                            turning good samaritan for
                            thousands of migrant workers during the two month long coronavirus induced lockdown.

But Sonu Sood is no stranger to random acts of kindness and generosity  deeds he attributes to the lasting
influence of his late parents, father Shakti Sagar Sood and mother Saroj Sood.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p id="text">
                Sonu Sood (born 30 July 1973) is an Indian actor, producer, model and philanthropist who works predominantly in Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil films.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p id="text"> Just last year, the actor sponsored the travel and stay for a team of differently-abled students who competed at the Special Olympics
                Asia Pacific Unified Badminton Championship in Bangkok.
                Sonu also fulfilled an ardent fanâ€™s lifelong dream last year by travelling all the way to Sri Lanka to attend her wedding.
            More recently, in April, the actor launched an initiative called Shakti Annadanam, again named after his late father, 
            to provide more than 150,000 meals daily to the underprivileged in Mumbai.
            <br><br>
In fact, on Friday, May 29, Sonu also arranged a chartered flight to take 150 stranded women labourers from an Ernakulam,
Kerala-based factory to their home state, Odisha.

One can go on but, admittedly, these acts of kindness come naturally to him.

                <b>Sonu Sood's inspiration: his late parents</b></h3>
            <p>
For the engineer-turned-actor, these are but the result of life-lessons and values taught to him and his sisters,
Monika and Malvika, by their late parents.</p>
            <p> <h4>"My mom and dad were the major inspirational pillars of my life. They taught me that you're successful only if you're able to help someone,"</h4></p>

                    Sonu Sood wanted to do his best to answer the plight of migrant workers who were desperate to reach their homes
                    across the country amidst the COVID-19 initial lockdown . GHAR BHEJO was their first initiative with their ally, Neeti Goel. They
                    collectively helped almost 100,000 migrants to reach their homes and unite with their families. This drive helped workers from 
                    various states in India including UP, Bihar, Karnataka, Orissa, Kerala, and others. They used many transportation methods like buses, 
                    trains, and chartered flights.
                    Their founder felt that it was his personal responsibility to support the common man.<br><br><a href="https://www.instamojo.com/@soodcharityfoundation/lcbf43d4ae0824ea4a4118175cd8e9d28/"><u >click here</u></a> to donate fund that can help migrants , students , people who are suffering due to lockdown.
